# Football World Cup Scoreboard

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of a scoreboard for World Cup football matches. It allows you to manage ongoing matches, update scores, and view a summary of matches ordered by their total score and start time.

The project is designed using Java with Maven and adheres to object-oriented programming principles (OOP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and SOLID principles.

## Features

The scoreboard supports the following operations:

1. **Start a new game**: Adds a new game to the scoreboard with an initial score of 0-0.
2. **Update score**: Allows updating the score of an existing game.
3. **Finish a game**: Removes an ongoing game from the scoreboard.
4. **Get a summary of ongoing games**: Displays a summary of ongoing games, ordered by total score, and in case of a tie, by the start time of the game.
